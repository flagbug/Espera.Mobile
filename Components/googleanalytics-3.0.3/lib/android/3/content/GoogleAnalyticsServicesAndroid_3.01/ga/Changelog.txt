Google Analytics SDK for Android Changelog

--------------------------------------------
Version: 3.01 (September 2013)
--------------------------------------------
* Second release of version 3.0.
* Made change required to avoid a runtime exception when an app targeting
  KitKat uses the SDK.


--------------------------------------------
Version: 3.00 (August 2013)
--------------------------------------------
* First release of version 3.0
* SDK API rewritten to more closely align with analytics.js.  See javadoc and
  https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/android/v3/
  for details.
* All track<hittype> and send<hittype> methods removed.  Instead, you can use
  the send method and the corresponding construct methods in the MapBuilder
  class to send hits. See the class Fields for a list of constants you can use
  to build hits using set and send.
* Many of the various properties have also been removed, including useHttps,
  anonymizeIp, etc.  You can set/reset those properties using the set command.
* EasyTracker now extends Tracker.  There is no need to call
  EasyTracker.getTracker to make tracking calls directly.
* The SDK no longer sets the session control flag to start on startup.
  Developers are now responsible for determining if a new session is needed.
  Note that EasyTracker still handles session management as before.
* The SDK now supports a custom logging class.  See Logger in the javadoc for
  details.
* Dryrun mode has been added.
* Clientid can now be read.  Simply call tracker.get(Fields.CLIENT_ID).  This
  call will block until the clientid has been loaded from the persistent store.
* The SDK will no longer retry hits based on the HTTP response code.
* The log tag was updated from "GAV2" to "GAV3".

--------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0beta5 (April 2013)
--------------------------------------------
* Fifth beta release.
* EasyTracker exception parsing bug fix. When ga_reportUncaughtExceptions
  flag is set, we were not initializing the exception parser, and as a result
  not parsing the location of an uncaught exception. With this fix, the
  crash and exception reports will report the location of uncaught exceptions
  when ga_reportUncaughtExceptions is set to true.

--------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0beta4 (January 2013)
--------------------------------------------
* Fourth beta release.
* The SDK will now respect the sample rate setting. If you previously set the
  sample rate to other than 100% you will now see a corresponding decrease in
  some of your Analytics metrics compared with beta 3.
* Changed track methods to send (e.g. trackView now called sendView).
* Use HTTPS by default instead of HTTP.
* SDK will not attempt to dispatch hits if there is no network connectivity.
* Avoid ANRs while attempting to handle install campaign data.
* Removed TrackedActivity classes from the SDK.
* Move SDK initialization off the main UI Thread.
* Improve the SDK's ability to recover from a corrupted SQLite database.
* AnalyticsReceiver renamed CampaignTrackingReceiver (also added
  CampaignTrackingService class, see javadoc for details).
* Several other crashes and bugs fixed.

  if no hits are queued for dispatch.
